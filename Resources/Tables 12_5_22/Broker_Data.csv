The home is being sold in as-is condition. No repairs or credits toward repairs will be offered by the seller. Sale is contingent upon approval from the court of chancery. All personal property in the home will transfer with the sale and become the responsibility of the buyer. The utilities are off and the seller will not turn them on.

All offers are due by the end of the day on Monday November 16th and the seller will review them the following day.

Updates include newer roof 50yr shingles (2007), windows and carpet.  The partial unfinished basement is space ready to be a workshop or just extra storage. All your parking needs are covered by the two-car attached garage, and the extra wide driveway. The home is solid and newer homes just don't compare. Some minor cosmetic painting and flooring could easily make this perfect. Don't miss a great opportunity to live in the City of Newark limits.
